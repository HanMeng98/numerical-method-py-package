I took the course 'Numerical Methods' in Purdue. I have defined several python functions in homework. In order to use them later on, I created a package to store these functions named 'numerical.py'.

These codes are based on python3 with numpy, sympy, math, matplotlib, copy packages.

If you find any error, welcome to point it out.
